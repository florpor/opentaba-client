[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/niryariv/opentaba-client.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/niryariv/opentaba-client)Client code for OpenTaba - details will arrive soon, but the code is pretty simple to understand.If you came looking for the server side of opentaba It's [here](https://github.com/niryariv/opentaba-server).##Testingsee [what's needed](tests/testing.md) with testing.##Production###ArchitectureThe production environment is made up of a github pages site per municipality, all being updated from onemain repository's master branch: [niryariv/opentaba-client](http://github.com/niryariv/opentaba-client/).This is done mainly to support different subdomains for different municipalities, but also to providethe ability to modify certain municipalities' sites without modifying all of them.###MaintenanceMaintenance is done using [fabric](http://fabfile.org), by activating different tasks defined in fabfile.py (for a list of all tasks, run `fab -l`, and for details about a specific task run `fab -d <task-name>`)To execute a task, run: `fab task-name:arg1,arg2...` or `fab task-name:arg1=val1,arg2=val2...`Main tasks:+ create_site (site_name) : create a new github repo, add a new remote to the local git repository for the new repo,   push (deploy) only to gh_pages branch, and edit the new repository's CNAME file for subdomain attaching.+ delete_site (site_name) : delete a github repository and remove it from the local git repository's remotes.+ deploy_all () : push all changes done in the local repository to all remote repositories defined in the   remote "all_sites".##Want to help?look at the issues. Lots of work here
